# Link-Aggregator-Site

 A link aggregator site (like reddit, hacker news, etc.) that supports user registration and login with the additional ability to post articles (links).
 Registering or logging in will create an authenticated session that contains all of the logged in user's information. Some elements on pages will only appear when a user is logged in. 
 Some pages will redirect to login if a user arrives unauthenticated. 
 The application is served only locally, and therefore not over an encrypted connection. 
 
## Features
- register a new account
- login using an existing account
- add a new article
- view all posted articles
- show a single article's details
- prevent / allow access to certain user interface elements or pages based on authenticated status
